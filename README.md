# STORE
## Storage Table Of Rapid Efficency
 
## About
This is my z-prefiz app. In keeping with the theme of three working days to build the crud app, I won't make any changes to the code. I will continue to work on deploying though. As it stands now at end of class on friday afternoon, the db and api have deployed succesffully, but the front end never came around.

##Instuctions
In order to run locally, you will need a docker container running postgresql. In the instance there should be a database with the name 'store'. Everything else should be able tobe run with an npm start in both the './store' and  './store_server'.
